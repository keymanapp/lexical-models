English MTNT Corpus
===================

This language model is derived from the [MTNT corpus][MTNT], collected
by Paul Michel and Graham Neubig whom mined discussions from [Reddit][].
Although the MTNT corpus has multilingual text, we are only using
English text.

The corpus is comprised of people having casual conversations on the
internet. **Note that the corpus can be R-rated at times!**

How the corpus was post-processed
---------------------------------

I concatenated both `monolingual/dev.en` and `monolingual/train.en` into
one file called `mtnt.en.txt`. Then, for each line (representing one
Reddit comment) I split words using Unicode's default word boundary
algorithm. I cleaned tokens by ensuring they are always in NFC, and
created types by lower-casing the words and removing common Latin
diacritics. I kept track both of the count of the type, and of the
different variations of the type. Variations are made mostly by
different letter-casing or different diacritics. Then, to create the
final wordlist, I selected the most common variation of each type.

Data filtering
--------------

The data was cleaned both manually and automatically to remove
objectionable terms. I initially used [profanties.en][] to remove
obviously bad words. I also went through about the top 4000 words to
remove anything I thought was probably offensive. Then I was inspired by
the [Seven dirty words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_dirty_words)
to look for all variants and creative ways to embed these words within
other words. I searched _within_ words, and manually verified all of
them to avoid making that [clbuttic mistake][]. That was ‚Äúfun‚Äù. This was
a pretty manual, and at times, subjective process. Exact replication may
not be guaranteed.

Additional filtering
--------------------

From May 2023 through February 2024 additional hand editing was done
to correct misspellings and remove non-words and many proper names.

Future work
-----------

* Keep separate files for proper names. Could be several files (personal names,
geographic names, company/product names, etc.)
* Include other endings (-s, -ed, -ing, etc.)
