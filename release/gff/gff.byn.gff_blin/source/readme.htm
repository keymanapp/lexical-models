<h1>Blin Lexical Model</h1>


<p>
This is an Blin (ብሊን, ISO-639-2 byn) lexical model developed to support predictive text in the
corresponding GFF Blin keyboard.  The lexical model relies on the UniLex projects's word
List for Blin.  The word list has been modified to remove English entries only but has not 
otherwise been reviewed to validate spelling. Spelling refinements and the incorporation of additional
word lists are goals of future development of this lexical model.
