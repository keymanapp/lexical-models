GFF Tigrinya Lexical Model
==========================

© 2020 – 2025 Geʾez Frontier Foundation

Version 1.3.1

Description
-----------

This is a Tigrinya (ትግርኛ , ISO-639-2 ti) lexical model developed to support predictive text in 
corresponding GFF Tigrinya keyboards.  The lexical model relies on the UniLex projects's word
List for Tigrinya.  The word list has been modified to remove English entries only.  The word
list has not otherwise been reviewed to validate spelling or separate Eritrean Tigrinya from
Ethiopian Tigrinya spelling conventions. These refinements are goals to be addressed in the
future development of this lexical model.
