<h1>Amharic Lexical Model</h1>

<p>
This is an Amharic (አማርኛ , ISO-639-2 am) lexical model developed to support predictive text in the
corresponding GFF Amharic keyboard, as well as other Amharic language keyboards.  The lexical model
is developed from manually typed corpus collections of selected books, newspaper, and magazine articles
from the 20th century.  The word lists have been modified to remove English entries only but has not
otherwise been reviewed to validate spelling. Spelling refinements and the incorporation of additional
content are goals of future development of this lexical model.
</p>

<p>For a full description of the corpus collections applied in this lexical model,
see the project <a href="https://github.com/keymanapp/lexical-models/blob/master/release/gff/gff.am.gff_amharic/README.md">README file</a>.
