GFF Tigrinya-Ethiopian Lexical Model
====================================


Description
-----------

This is a Tigrinya (ትግርኛ , ISO-639-2 ti-ET) lexical model developed to support predictive text in 
the corresponding GFF Tigrinya-Ethiopia keyboard.  The lexical model is based on the content found from 100
issues of the Wegahta (ወጋሕታ) newspaper. English words have been removed from the generated word list,
but quality checks for spelling, etc. have not been performed.  These checks are left as a goal for a
future version of the lexical model.
