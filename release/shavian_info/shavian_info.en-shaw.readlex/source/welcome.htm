  <p>Shaw ReadLex 1.0 generated from template.</p>
  <h1>Wordlist Model Documentation</h1>
  <p>The Shaw ReadLex lexical model is a wordlist of some 85,000 words ordered by frequency in the British National Corpus and spelled in the Shavian alphabet. The spellings adopted are those in the Kingsley Read Lexicon published by Shavian.info at <a href="https://www.shavian.info/dictionary/">https://www.shavian.info/dictionary/</a>, which is ultimately derived from the "rhotic Received Pronunciation" standard used in the Shaw Alphabet edition of Androcles and the Lion (1962).</p>
  <p>Shaw ReadLex is intended for use with the Shaw Imperial and Shaw QWERTY keyboards available for Keyman. When installed, it provides these keyboards with a rudimentary predictive text capability that reduces typographic errors and increases speed.</p>
